# 🎓 CampusHive - Backend

**CampusHive** is a scalable and robust back-end API powering an intuitive ed-tech platform for modern learning environments. It supports course management, secure user authentication, payment integration, media handling, and more — all developed using the **MERN** stack and deployed on scalable cloud infrastructure.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for building scalable backend services
- **Express.js** – Web framework for building REST APIs
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for structured and flexible data
- **Mongoose** – ODM to simplify MongoDB operations
- **Cloudinary** – Media file (image/video) storage and optimization
- **JWT** – Secure authentication tokens
- **Bcrypt** – Password hashing for enhanced security
- **Razorpay** – Payment integration
- **Nodemailer** – Email service for OTPs and password resets

## 🏗️ Backend Architecture

- ✅ **Monolithic Architecture**: Built using a single Node.js + Express.js application.
- ✅ **RESTful APIs**: All functionalities exposed through HTTP endpoints using standard methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- ✅ **MVC Pattern**: Organized using Controllers, Models, Routes, and Utilities for clean separation of concerns.
